/**
 * Created by Yinevg on 2019/8/3
 * Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Input: 38
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2.
 * Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
 * Follow up:
 * Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
